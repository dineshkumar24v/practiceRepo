		<h2 style="color:red">How web browsers work:</h2>
		<p>Browsers are responsible for retrieving and displaying web content to users. When a user enters a URL or clicks on a link, the browser initiates a complex series of actions to retrieve the web content from a server and display it on the userâ€™s device.</p>

		<h3 style="color:blue">Protocol:</h3>
		<p><b>Protocol</b> is a set of rules and standards that define how data is transmitted and received over a network. Protocols ensure that devices on a network can communicate effectively reliably, and securely. They cover various aspects, including data format, signaling, authentication, and error detection.</p>
		<h3 style="color:blue">HTTP :</h3>
		<p><b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</b> is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes, such as machine-to-machine communication, programmatic access to APIs, and more.</p>
		<img src="https://bunnyacademy.b-cdn.net/6Jwd8-What-is-The-Hypertext-Transfer-Protocol-HTTP.png" width="750" height="">

<p><b>Purpose:</b>The foundation of data communication on the web.</P>

<p><b>Function:</b>Defines how messeges are formatted and transmitted and how web servers and browser should respond to various commmands.</p>

<p><b>Port:</b>Typically uses port 80.</p>

<p><b>Stateless Protocol:</b>Each request form a cleint to a server is independent.</p>
		
		<h3 style="color:blue">HTTPS :</h3>

		<h4>Hypertext transfer protocol secure:</h4>

		<p><b>Purpose:</b>Secure version of HTTP.</p>

		<p><b>Function:</b>Uses encryption to secure dara between the client and server,providing confidentiality and intergrity.</p>

		<p><b>Port:</b>Typicallu uses port 443.</p>

		<p><b>Encryption:</b>Uses SSL/TLS protocols for encryption.</p>

		<h3 style="color:blue">Domain:</h3>
		<p>A domain name is unique address used to identify a website on the internet.</p>
		<h3 style="color:blue">Domain name system (DNS):</h3>

		<p>A domain name System (dns) is a hierarchical system that translates human-readable.</p>

		<h3 style="color:blue">Sub domain:</h3>

		<p>A sub domain is an additional part of your main domain name it helps organize and navigate to different sections of yours website sub domains cab be used to create unique url's for a different content areas such as a blog a store or supports pages without nedding to purchase additional domain names</p>

		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  			<li><p style="color:green"><u>blog.example.com</u></p></li>
 			<li><p style="color:green"><u>shop.example.com</u></p></li>
  			<li><p style="color:green"><u>forum.example.com</u></p></li>
		</ul>

		<h3 style="color:blue">Top Level Domain(TLD) :</h3>
		<p>TLDs are fundamental components of the domain name system playing a crucial role in organizing and identifying websites on the internet. They help in categorizing domains establishing,credibility and supporting branding efforts. Understanding TDLs is essential for anyone involved in web-devleopment, <u>SEO(Search Engine Optimization)</u> or <u>Digital marketing</u>.</p>

		<h4>Popular TLDs and Their Uses :</h4>
		
		<ul style="list-style-type:square">
  			<li><p><b> .com---</b> Commercial entites, the most popular and widely recognised TLD</p></li>
  			<li><p><b>.org---</b> Non-profit organization, open to anyone.</p></li>
  		   	<li><p><b>.net---</b> Orginally for network services, now open to anyone.</p></li>
			<li><p><b>.edu---</b> Educational institutions, restricted to accredited entities.</p></li>
  			<li><p><b>.gov---</b> U.S.government entities, restricted.</p></li>
  		   	<li><p><b>.in---</b> Indian websites.</p></li>
		</ul>

		<h2 style="color:red">SDLC(Software development Life Cycle):</h2>
		<p>The <b>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</b> is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software. The goal of SDLC is to minimize project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond. This methodology outlines a series of steps that divide the software development process into tasks you can assign, complete, and measure.</p>

		<h4>Stage-1: Requirement Analysis</h4>
		<p>Identify and document the requirements.clients define the project goal and scope.</p>

		<h4>Stage-2:Designing</h4>
		<p>In this phase, the software design is created, which includes the overall architecture of the software, data structures, and interfaces. It has two steps:</p>
		<p>High-level design (HLD): It gives the architecture of software products.</p>
		<p>Low-level design (LLD): It describes how each and every feature in the product should work and every component.</p>

		<h4>Stage-3:developing</h4>
		<p>The design is then implemented in code, usually in several iterations, and this phase is also called as Development.This is the longest phase in SDLC model.</p>

		<h4>Stage-4:Testing</h4>
		<p>The software is thoroughly tested to ensure that it meets the requirements and works correctly.</p>

		<h4>Stage-5:deployement</h4>
		<p>After successful testing, The software is deployed to a production environment and made available to end-users.</p>

		<h4>Stage-6:maintainence</h4>
		<p>This phase includes ongoing support, bug fixes, and updates to the software.</p>

		<h2 style="color:red">What is Agile Methodology?</h2>
		<p>The <b>Agile methodology</b> is a project management approach that involves breaking the project into phases and emphasizes continuous collaboration and improvement. Teams follow a cycle of <u>planning</u>, <u>executing</u>, and <u>evaluating</u>.</p>

		<h2 style="color:red">What is Waterfall Methodology?</h2>
		<p>The <b>Waterfall methodology</b> is a well-established project management workflow. Like a waterfall, each process phase cascades downward sequentially through five stages (requirements, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance).</p>

		<h2 style="color:red">DevOps(Development Operations) :</h2>
		<p>DevOps is a combination of software development (dev) and operations (ops). </p>
		<p><b>DevOps</b> is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams. It emphasizes team empowerment, cross-team communication and collaboration, and technology automation.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Devops team will secure data Deployment through CI/CD Pipelines.</li>
			<li>They will adjust the storage Requirement by upscaling and downscaling.</li>
			<li>They ensure Maintainance of the project after development.</li>
		</ul>
<p>Popular DevOps tools include <b>Git, Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, Puppet, Chef, Nagios, Kubernetes, and Azure DevOps.</b> </p>
